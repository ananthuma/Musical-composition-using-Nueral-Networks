## Overview
Our project implements a neural network based musical composer which
can compose music its own.Neural networks process information in a similar
way the human brain does. Neural network model learns to predict which
notes will be played at each time step of a musical piece after training the
system with some classical compositions. The network can only produce
textual representation of music so converting musical notes into digital mu-
sic also come under this project.
